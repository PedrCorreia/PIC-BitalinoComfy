# PIC-2025 Robust View Switcher

## Overview
The Robust View Switcher is a solution designed to fix view mode switching issues in the PIC-2025 visualization tool, particularly addressing the crash that occurs when transitioning from TWIN view back to RAW view at approximately 32 seconds runtime.

## Problem Addressed
The PIC-2025 visualization tool has been experiencing instability when users switch between different view modes (RAW, PROCESSED, and TWIN). Specifically, a critical crash occurs when:
- The user has been in the TWIN view for an extended period (around 30+ seconds)
- The user attempts to switch back to the RAW view

## Solution
The `robust_view_switcher.py` script implements several key improvements:

1. **Safe View Switching Mechanism**
   - Implements careful state management during transitions
   - Special handling for the problematic TWIN → RAW transition
   - Signal clearing and memory management between view changes

2. **Simplified Signal Management**
   - Uses minimal signal sets to reduce complexity and memory usage
   - Specially handles signal pairs in TWIN view to avoid overloading

3. **Defensive Programming**
   - Guards against exceptions at every stage of view switching
   - Implements improved error handling and recovery
   - Uses timed delays at critical points in the transition process

4. **Multi-stage View Transitions**
   - Pre-clears signals before changing views
   - Introduces buffer renders between complex view changes
   - Allows sufficient time for state changes to take effect

## Usage
To use the Robust View Switcher:

1. Run the `run_robust_view_switcher.bat` batch file
2. The script will automatically:
   - Start or find the visualization component
   - Register simple demo signals
   - Apply the robust view switching mechanism
   - Run a demonstration cycle through all view modes
   - Continue monitoring and periodically cycling views

## Technical Details
The fix works by intercepting view mode changes and implementing a multistage transition process:

1. When the critical TWIN → RAW transition is detected:
   - All signals are cleared from memory
   - A brief pause allows for memory cleanup
   - A blank render is forced to reset the rendering state
   - Another pause ensures the system is stable
   - Only then is the actual view mode changed
   - Finally, appropriate signals are loaded for the new view

2. The specialized signal-loading logic:
   - Maintains view-appropriate signals only (raw signals in RAW view, etc.)
   - Limits the number of signals in complex views
   - Creates appropriate signal pairings for TWIN view

## Testing
The script has been tested extensively, demonstrating:
- Stable transitions between all view modes
- No crashes during the previously problematic TWIN → RAW transition
- Long-term stability with periodic view cycling

## Future Improvements
While this solution addresses the immediate issue, future work could include:
- Integration of this fix into the core PIC-2025 visualization system
- Further memory optimization for the TWIN view
- More sophisticated signal pairing algorithms for complex visualizations
