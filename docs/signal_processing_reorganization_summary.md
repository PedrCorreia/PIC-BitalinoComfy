# Signal Processing Reorganization Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Removed Duplicate Code**
   - Eliminated the duplicate `signal_processor.py` from the plot folder 
   - Now using the core `NumpySignalProcessor` from `src/utils/signal_processing.py`

2. **Created Specialized Components**
   - `SignalHistoryManager`: Focused solely on managing signal history for visualization
   - `SignalProcessingAdapter`: Provides simplified access to core signal processing algorithms

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Created `signal_processing.md` explaining the architecture
   - Created `signal_processing_migration.md` to guide migration from old to new structure
   - Updated README.md with the new organization

4. **Added Example Implementation**
   - Created `SignalView` as an example of using the new components
   - Created a demo script showing the restructured components in action

5. **Enhanced Directory Structure**
   - Organized signal processing utilities in appropriate directories
   - Maintained clear separation between visualization and processing

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - All signal processing algorithms are defined once in the core module
   - Prevents duplication and ensures consistency

2. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Core algorithms are independent of visualization
   - Components are focused on specific responsibilities

3. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Updates to algorithms only need to happen in one place
   - Clean interfaces between components

4. **Optimized Performance**
   - Core implementations are optimized for different hardware (CPU, GPU, CUDA)
   - Memory-efficient storage for signal history

## Next Steps

1. **Update Dependent Components**
   - Check and update any components that were using the old signal processor
   - Ensure all imports point to the correct modules

2. **Testing**
   - Test the new structure with real-world signals
   - Verify that visualization works correctly with the new components

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Complete any remaining documentation
   - Ensure all code has comprehensive docstrings
