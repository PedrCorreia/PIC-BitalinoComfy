# PIC-2025 Signal Registry Integration

## Integration Summary

This integration resolves the conflicts between two separate `__init__.py` files in the PIC-2025 custom nodes package for ComfyUI. The main integration goal was to combine the initialization code from both files while ensuring proper node registration.

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated Node Registration**: All nodes are now registered in the main `__init__.py` file
   - Eliminated duplicate registrations
   - Organized nodes into logical categories
   - Added consistent emoji-based icons to all node display names

2. **Optimized Import Structure**: 
   - Added better error handling for each module import
   - Simplified import logic and made it more maintainable
   - Consistent try/except blocks for each node type

3. **Enhanced Node Categorization**:
   - Created dedicated registry categories:
     - Pedro_PIC/ðŸŒŠ Signal Registry
     - Pedro_PIC/ðŸ”¬ Diagnostics
   - Maintained existing categories for other node types

4. **Updated Node Implementations**:
   - Now using the newest version of SignalInputNode
   - All registry nodes properly connected to the signal system

## Additional Improvements

1. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed INTEGRATION.md explaining the integration process
   - Added clear categorization for all node types
   - Documented the debugging tools available

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Better error reporting during node registration
   - Clear import error messages for troubleshooting
   - More robust initialization process

3. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Simplified the comfy/__init__.py file to prevent duplication
   - Consolidated all node registration logic in one place
   - Clearer debugging messages during initialization

## Testing

This integration has been successfully tested and ensures that all nodes are properly registered and available to ComfyUI. The Signal Registry system now operates correctly with consistent node categories and display names.
